# __init__.py is typically an empty file that indicates that the directory it's in is a Python package.
# Since this is an Alembic migrations folder, it might not need any content in __init__.py.
# However, if we were to include any shared logic or configurations for migrations, it would go here.
# For now, we'll leave this file empty as per standard practice for Alembic migrations.

# This file is intentionally left blank.
